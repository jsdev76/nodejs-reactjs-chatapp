## Get DigitalOcean account

I have been using <a href="https://m.do.co/c/bb792e37b9dd">DigitalOcean</a> for me and setup for my customers, so  recommend use it for your project just pick vps depend on how big of your project
start at 5$ or 10$, 10$, price very flexiblity. DO providing SSD cloud hosting but good price i dont think you can get same price on other providers with same quality.
beside their support very fast and well documentation , friendly UI for end-user. 
so let get start register an account and deploy your app at <a href="https://m.do.co/c/bb792e37b9dd">Digitalocean.com</a>
